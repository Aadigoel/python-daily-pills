# Python daily pills - Day 007: Python Comments

Comments can be used to explain Python code.

Comments can be used to make the code more readable.

Comments can be used to prevent execution when testing code.

> Note: Always prefer a clean and more concise code than comments. Check the links in the end of this post about the best use for comments.

Examples:

```python
#This is a comment
print("Hello, World!")

print("Hello, World!") #This is a comment

#This is a comment
#written in
#more than just one line
print("Hello, World!")

"""
This is a comment
written in
more than just one line
"""
print("Hello, World!")
```
