# How to contribute

First off, thank you for considering contributing to Python daily pills. It's people like you that keep the world safe from bad Python code.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Project Changes Happen Through Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. First [check](./README.md) if the content you want to contribute already exists.
1. If doesn't, fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
1. Make a copy of the file `pill/contrib/CONTRIB-TEMPLATE.md` in the same folder. Name it like `your_pill_title.md`
1. Write your pill.
1. Issue that pull request!
